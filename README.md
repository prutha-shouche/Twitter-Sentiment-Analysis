# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis

## Data

This project seeks to identify hate speech in Twitter. For ease of use, we define a tweet as having hate speech inside it if it has a racist or sexist emotion.So, the task is to classify racist or sexist tweets from other tweets.

Our goal is to predict the labels on the test dataset using the training sample of tweets and labels, where label "1" indicates a tweet is racist or sexist and label "0" indicates a tweet is neither racist or sexist.

We have taken a labeled dataset of 31,962 tweets for training the models. Each line in the csv file containing the dataset contains a tweet id, its label, and the tweet itself.
